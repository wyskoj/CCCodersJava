<h1>Logical operators</h1>

<p>We saw previously how to compare two numbers. What if we needed to make more than one comparison? We can use
    a <em>logical operator</em>. Put simply, this is how we tell the computer to say "and", "or", and "not".</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>and</th>
        <th>or</th>
        <th>not</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&amp;&amp;</code></td>
        <td><code>||</code></td>
        <td><code>!</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>And</h2>
The first if-statement checks if both numbers are positive. Fill in the TODO with the code to
do this.

<div class="hint">
  To check if a number is positive, it has to be greater than 0. To check if two things are both true, write both checks and put a <code>&amp;&amp;</code> in between them.
</div>

<h2>Or</h2>
The second if-statement checks if <code>numA</code> or <code>numB</code> is equal to <code>4</code>. Fill in the TODO with the code to
do this.

<div class="hint">
  Recall to compare if numbers are equal, we use two equal signs (<code>==</code>). To see if at least one of two checks is true, write a <code>||</code> in between.
</div>

<h2>Not</h2>
<p>The second if-statement checks if <code>word</code> is adverb. We will use the <code>.endsWith()</code> function to see if the
    word ends with "ly". The function wants a string in its parenthesis, like <code>.endsWith("ly")</code>. Write an exclamation mark
    at the beginning of the check to negate it.</p>
<div class="hint">
  Write it like this:<br>
    <code>!word.endsWith("ly")</code>
</div>
