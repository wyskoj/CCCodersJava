# Comparing numbers

Welcome to Week 3!

To begin, we'll learn how to make decisions based on data. Write a program that tells the user if their number is larger
than, or less than or equal to 5.

Much of the code is already given to you; it's your job to fill in the blanks! Wherever you see `/* TODO */`, you need
to write the correct code.

To finish this example:

* Write the correct "function" to get an `int` from the user (after `myScanner`)
* Write the correct conditional in the if-block

**Important:**

* The variable `x` is given to you. Use this whenever you need to use 5.
* Use the `<` sign for "less-than"

Stuck on the input?
<div class="hint"> 
    Remember that once we have created our Scanner, we can use it to get input from the user.
    In this example, we want to get an integer that the user types.
    Recall the function for getting input is <code>nextInt()</code>.
</div>

Stuck on the if statement?
<div class="hint">
    Think of the if-statement like a question.
    We ask a true/false question, perform an action if the answer to that question is true, or some other action if it's false.
    In this case, we want to ask the question, "is the number greater than 5?" If it is, then we need to print out that "your number
    is greater than 5." Otherwise, we need to say "your number is less than or equal to 5."
